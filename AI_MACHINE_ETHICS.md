# AI / ML Machine Code of Ethics

## Personal research use

The AI Machine is a resource intended for personal and research use relevant to your work and studies while at the Royal College of Art only. You accept the associated risks and liabilities, and you understand that the XR team reserves the final right to revoke access to this resource.

## Copyrighted content

Wherever possible, you agree to obtain the proper rights to use copyrighted material, and when not possible, you agree to acknowledge and disclose the sources of your data. When using or recreating the likeness of a specific person(s), you agree to make a reasonable attempt to secure their consent prior.

## Restricted content

Generating violent, pornographic, or harmful content with AI is somewhat restricted by the models themselves, but you may want to engage in the ongoing discourse and research around potentially harmful AI generated content. When doing so, you acknowledge the potential harms that such work poses to both real individuals and society at large, and you agree to act ethically and with your best moral compass.

## Support

If unsure of any of the above, please feel free to reach out for guidance to the technical team in the XR Lab or to the Creative Coding technician at [kevin.lee@rca.ac.uk](mailto:kevin.lee@rca.ac.uk)

## Future amendments to this agreement

AI / ML safety is an ongoing topic of discussion and as such there may be changes and amendments to this agreement in the future. Any alterations or additions will result in the creation of new versions of this agreement, which will then have to be re-signed by the associated parties.
